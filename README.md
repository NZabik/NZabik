## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Nicolas Zabik,
At 41 years old, after working in the field of quality management, I embraced a career as an **Application Designer and Developer** following my diploma in **Web and Mobile Web Development**.

My training has equipped me with strong skills in development, design, project management, and communication.
My curiosity drives me to continuously learn.

My passion for web and mobile development pushes me to constantly seek out new and stimulating projects.

I particularly enjoy teamwork and am always ready to take on new challenges.

Since the beginning of my training, I have successfully completed numerous projects, which has allowed me to gain solid experience in web and mobile development.

I am proficient in several programming languages, including:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- PHP
- among others.

I specialize in several frameworks such as:
- Symfony
- WordPress
- Angular

- React

I am also skilled in design and capable of creating mockups and prototypes.
